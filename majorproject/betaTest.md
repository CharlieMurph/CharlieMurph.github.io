# **Ideas from Beta testing**


Asir:
~ Need info box to show controls
~ include a way to reload the game without refreshing the page.
- /It would be cool if you could resize the screen and the game would adjust automatically? Just an extra thing to add on the Nice to Have list.
- /Enemies are too hard... I got -80 -.-

Eden:
~ make enemies who don't get killed only -5 from the score, not the full 10
