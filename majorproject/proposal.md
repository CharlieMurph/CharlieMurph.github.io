# **Proposal**

I want to build a project that allows 2 people to play "Stratego"

#### **Need to have list:**
- Functional map that is traversable
- Different players with basic models
- Different players have special movement capabilities
- Players can initially place all Different players within their territory
- Players can move, battle, die and win/lose game

#### **Nice to have list:**
- More complex player models
- Easy to play game
- Main Menu
- Pre-game instructions
- AI
